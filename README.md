# Simple App - complete

---

Our target is to create a simple app to send a data message to the tangle, using the iota-client.

---

This repository contains the completed source code, after all implementation steps for Android, macOS and iOS. It is part of the [_IOTA for Flutter_](https://iota-for-flutter.github.io/tutorial) Tutorial.

In terms of functionality, the app allows users to enter a message and a tag, which are then sent to the Shimmer Networks' Tangle after validation.

## Usage of the repository

I recommend setting up the project from scratch. I don't have experience in downloading the repository and magically getting it up and running with a single install command. That's why I refer you to the tutorial and the series of videos explaining the build process. Start with the chapter:
